# Wine Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the process of classifying white wines into different quality categories based on their physicochemical properties. The project adopts a scientific data analysis approach, leveraging various machine learning models to predict wine quality.

## Project Overview

Wine quality assessment has been a crucial part of the wine production and trade industries for centuries. This project aims to objectify the wine quality evaluation process by using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing a dataset of white wines, we classify wines into different quality categories, thus providing an automated way to assess wine quality based on intrinsic characteristics such as visual aspects, taste, and smell, as well as physicochemical components like acidity, pH, etc.
